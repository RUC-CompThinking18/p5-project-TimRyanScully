# Interactivity
You had a great idea here, and you executed it well. You had multiple means of interaction that clearly changed what was drawn on the screen. My only quibble is that it might have been good to label the buttons, since I didn't know the down arrow would go all the way to the end, but that's minor.

# Code Quality
You used P5's resources really well here. I especially liked that you loaded your images in in an array and had a mix of bitmap images and things drawn with P5's functions. A challenge for later: can you write a function that will check for collision on a mouseclick rather than having to rewrite those if/else statements every time?

# Aesthetics
This was a fun little project that did a lot given the short amount of time I gave you guys to work. Really great work here.
